                <p>I have no background in coding, but since I am a Communication Design major, most of my senior classmates took this class last year. I heard great things, and liked the idea of learning a bit of coding, so here I am! </p>

                <p><a href=https://spark.adobe.com/>https://spark.adobe.com/</a> : Adobe Spark's website exemplifies effective communication because it clearly explains how the app can be used, while also mimicking the style of the app's presentations.</p>

                <p><strong>Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</strong></p>
                <p><a href=https://www.canva.com/>https://www.canva.com/</a> : You may not be able to see the interface without an account, but Canva is a website that I think works beautifully well because it is like Illustrator simplified. All the elements are easy to find, download, and share. I use it for my job, so thank goodness it works well!</p>
