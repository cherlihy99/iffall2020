    <main>
        <p class="v1">Don't put my love on your back burner</p>
        <p class="v1">Never let anything that hot get cold</p>
        <p class="v1">And if you ever change your mind</p>
        <p class="v1">Want to leave my love behind</p>
        <p class="v1">Just let me be the second one to know</p>
        <p class="v1">Yeah, the second one to know</p>

        <br>

        <p class="v1">Hold up my right hand</p>
        <p class="v1">Swear to the Promised Land</p>
        <p class="v1">Rather die before I treat you bad</p>
        <p class="v1">All I ask of you</p>
        <p class="v1">Is treat me the same way, too</p>
        <p class="v1">'Cause I don't want to lose this thing we have</p>

        <br>
        
        <p class="v1">Don't put my love on your back burner</p>
        <p class="v1">Never let anything that hot get cold</p>
        <p class="v1">And if you ever change your mind</p>
        <p class="v1">Want to leave my love behind</p>
        <p class="v1">Just let me be the second one to know</p>
        <p class="v1">Yeah, the second one to know</p>

        <br>

        <p class="v1">First, you stole my heart</p>
        <p class="v1">That was the easy part</p>
        <p class="v1">Don't ever tell me that crime don't pay</p>
        <p class="v1">Now that it's in your hands</p>
        <p class="v1">Want you to understand</p>
        <p class="v1">I would have given it to you anyway</p>

        <br>


        <p class="v1">Don't put my love on your back burner</p>
        <p class="v1">Never let anything that hot get cold</p>
        <p class="v1">And if you ever change your mind</p>
        <p class="v1">Want to leave my love behind</p>
        <p class="v1">Just let me be the second one to know</p>
        <p class="v1">Yeah, the second one to know</p>
